# Inventory Manager

Description
---------
Inventory manager is a web application to manage hardware items of any organization.
Every item of inventory can either be returnable or non-returnable. Items can be created and updated
in the system by either manager or admin. The items would also be shareable or non - shareable.
Users would be of three types: Admin, Inventory Manager and Member of inventory. Admin and
Managers are also a member of that inventory. All users would have access to the system with access
to specific pages and specific functionalities based on their type.
